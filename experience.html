        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>This summer I went to the University of Michigan's Geology field station to gain hands-on experience in geologic and ecologic research practices and methods. Picture are currently being uploaded to the Photo Gallery, so please check out the amazing biodiversity and geological features that Rocky Mountain ecosystems have to offer, and that I was so lucky to experience.</p>
